# motd

`motd` is a crate for printing the current MOTD (message of the day)
on linux. Most of the logic lives in the `motd` crate, and the `dump-motd`
tool is a thin wrapper which provides a command line interface for the
crate.

`motd` is currently an unusable prototype, but the intention is to
use it as part of shpool.
